# MP3 File Repair Tool

This is a Python script for repairing encrypted MP3 files by removing additional data appended to the end of the file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/DRCRecoveryData/mp3-file-repair.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory in File Explorer.

## Usage

1. Double-click on `mp3_repair.py` to run the script.

2. Enter the path to the encrypted MP3 file when prompted.

3. The repaired file will be saved in the "Repaired" folder within the project directory.

## Example

Enter the path to the encrypted MP3 file: path\to\encrypted.mp3
Repaired file saved to: Repaired\encrypted_repaired.mp3

## How it Works

The script reads the provided MP3 file, removes the trailing encrypted data, and writes the repaired content to a new file.
